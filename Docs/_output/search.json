    "text": "0.1 The Platform: Arduino Nano\nFor this project, we chose the Arduino Nano as our main controller specifically for its constrained environment. When we can achieve efficiency and speed within such limitations, we learn how to optimize ideas, algorithms, and programs - skills that are valuable across all computing platforms. The Arduino Nano, based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, offers a small form factor (45 x 18 mm), ideal for compact robot designs. It includes 32KB of Flash memory, suitable for our advanced logging system, 2KB of SRAM for runtime operations, and runs at 16MHz, providing adequate processing power. The board features multiple analog inputs for our sensor array, PWM outputs for precise motor control, and maintains low power consumption while being cost-effective for both prototyping and final implementation.",

    "text": "0.2 Project Overview\nIn most projects, adjusting a line following robot for speed and efficiency becomes a tedious and time-consuming trial-and-error routine. Our project addresses this challenge by incorporating an advanced logging and analysis system that transforms the tuning process into a data-driven approach. The robot includes high-precision line detection using a 6-sensor array, PID-based motion control for smooth operation, and dual operating modes for analysis and high-speed performance. The comprehensive data logging system enables real-time performance monitoring, with flash-based storage for post-run analysis and a USB interface for data retrieval and analysis, providing the tools necessary for systematic testing and configuration.",

    "section": "0.3 Why C++?",
    "text": "0.3 Why C++?\nThe choice of C++ as our programming language was deliberate and based on several key factors. C++ allows us to organize our code into logical classes and modules, making the system more maintainable and easier to understand. This is particularly important for complex systems like our logging mechanism. The language provides low-level hardware access while supporting high-level abstractions, crucial for real-time operations where microseconds matter, such as sensor reading and motor control.\nWith limited resources on the Arduino Nano, C++’s efficient memory management and minimal runtime overhead are essential. We can precisely control memory allocation and ensure optimal use of the available RAM. The language’s support for namespaces, classes, and templates helps maintain clean code architecture despite the system’s complexity. C++’s strong type system helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, which is crucial for a system that needs to operate autonomously. Additionally, C++ allows us to create clean abstractions over hardware components while maintaining direct access when needed, making the code both maintainable and efficient. The object-oriented features facilitate code reuse and modular design, making it easier to extend or modify the robot’s functionality.\nThe combination of Arduino Nano’s capabilities with C++’s features allows us to create a sophisticated line following robot that not only performs its primary function but also provides valuable insights into its operation through advanced logging and analysis capabilities.",

The DEBUG_LEVEL setting determines the robot’s operating mode and what features are compiled into the final binary.\n// Set to 1 for analysis mode, 2 for speed mode, or 0 for normal operation\n#ifndef DEBUG_LEVEL\n#define DEBUG_LEVEL 0\n#endif\n\n#if DEBUG_LEVEL &gt; 0\n#include \"DataStructures.h\"  // Include debug-related structures\n\n// Debug configuration\nstatic constexpr uint8_t DEBUG_LAPS_MODE1 = 5;    // Analysis mode laps\nstatic constexpr uint8_t DEBUG_LAPS_MODE2 = 3;    // Speed mode laps\n\n// Logging parameters\nstatic constexpr uint16_t SAMPLE_RATE_STRAIGHT = 50;   // Sampling in straight lines\nstatic constexpr uint16_t SAMPLE_RATE_CURVE = 20;      // Sampling in curves\nstatic constexpr uint16_t LOG_BUFFER_SIZE = 64;        // Circular buffer size\n\n// Flash memory parameters\nstatic constexpr uint32_t FLASH_LOG_START = 0x1000;    // Log start address\nstatic constexpr uint16_t FLASH_PAGE_SIZE = 256;       // Flash page size\nstatic constexpr uint32_t FLASH_CONTROL_BYTE = 0x0800; // Control byte location\nstatic constexpr uint8_t FLASH_LOG_READY = 0xAA;       // Log ready indicator\n#endif\nThe debug configuration implements a conditional compilation system that ensures optimal performance in normal operation. When DEBUG_LEVEL is set to 0, all debugging code is completely excluded from the final binary, resulting in no runtime overhead. Setting DEBUG_LEVEL to 1 activates the analysis mode, where the robot operates at moderate speeds and collects comprehensive data about its performance, including position errors, motor speeds, and PID corrections, completing 5 laps for detailed analysis. In speed mode, activated with DEBUG_LEVEL 2, the robot performs 3 laps at maximum speed while still collecting performance data, allowing for optimization of high-speed behaviour. The system adjusts its sampling rate based on track conditions - sampling more frequently in curves where behaviour is more dynamic, and at a lower rate in straight sections to conserve memory. All collected data is stored in a structured format in flash memory, organized to maximize data integrity and facilitate post-run analysis.\nThe flash memory organization is carefully structured to maximize efficiency and reliability. The logging system begins storing data at address 0x1000 (FLASH_LOG_START), providing ample space for system data in lower memory addresses. Each page of flash memory is 256 bytes (FLASH_PAGE_SIZE), allowing efficient writing operations that balance between memory usage and write cycles. A control byte located at address 0x0800 (FLASH_CONTROL_BYTE) serves as a state indicator for the logging system. When this byte contains the value 0xAA (FLASH_LOG_READY), it signals that valid performance data is available for retrieval, ensuring proper synchronization between data logging and retrieval operations.\n\n\n4.1.2 Pin Configuration\nDefines all hardware connections, centralizing pin assignments for easy modification and hardware revision control.\n// Only modify if changing physical robot connections\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_START_BUTTON = 11;      // Start/calibrate button\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_STATUS_LED = 13;        // Status LED\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MOTOR_LEFT_FWD = 7;     // Left Motor Forward\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MOTOR_LEFT_REV = 4;     // Left Motor Reverse\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MOTOR_LEFT_PWM = 3;     // Left Motor Speed\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MOTOR_RIGHT_FWD = 8;    // Right Motor Forward\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MOTOR_RIGHT_REV = 9;    // Right Motor Reverse\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MOTOR_RIGHT_PWM = 10;   // Right Motor Speed\n\n// Sensor pins\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_LINE_LEFT_EDGE = A6;    // Leftmost sensor\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_LINE_LEFT_MID = A5;\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_LINE_CENTER_LEFT = A4;\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_LINE_CENTER_RIGHT = A3;\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_LINE_RIGHT_MID = A2;\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_LINE_RIGHT_EDGE = A1;   // Rightmost sensor\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MARKER_LEFT = A7;       // Left marker\nstatic const uint8_t PIN_MARKER_RIGHT = A0;      // Right marker\nThe pin configuration employs a systematic approach to hardware interface management. Each pin assignment is thoroughly documented with clear comments indicating its purpose, from motor control signals to sensor inputs, making hardware modifications and debugging straightforward. Related pins are logically grouped together - motor control pins are clustered by function (forward, reverse, and PWM for each motor), while sensor pins are arranged according to their physical layout on the robot (from left edge to right edge). The use of static const declarations for pin assignments not only makes the code more readable but also allows the compiler to optimize memory usage by storing these values in program memory rather than RAM. This approach maintains flexibility for hardware modifications while ensuring efficient runtime performance, as these values are resolved at compile time rather than being calculated during program execution.\n\n\n4.1.3 Speed Parameters\nDefines the various speed levels used by the robot, providing a comprehensive speed control system.\n// Base speeds - do not modify without thorough testing\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_STOP = 0;       // Stopped\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_STARTUP = 80;   // Initial movement\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_TURN = 100;     // Turn speed\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_BRAKE = 120;    // Braking speed\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_CRUISE = 140;   // Medium speed\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_SLOW = 160;     // Precision mode\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_FAST = 180;     // High speed\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_BOOST = 200;    // Boost speed\nstatic constexpr uint8_t SPEED_MAX = 220;      // Maximum speed\n\n// Speed control parameters\nstatic constexpr uint8_t ACCELERATION_STEP = 25;   // Speed increase step\nstatic constexpr uint8_t BRAKE_STEP = 60;         // Speed decrease step\nstatic constexpr uint8_t TURN_SPEED = 120;        // Curve speed\nstatic constexpr uint8_t TURN_THRESHOLD = 45;     // Curve detection\nstatic constexpr uint8_t STRAIGHT_THRESHOLD = 20;  // Straight line detection\nstatic constexpr uint8_t BOOST_DURATION = 10;     // Boost time\nstatic constexpr uint8_t BOOST_INCREMENT = 20;    // Boost step\nThese speed constants and control parameters are extensively used throughout the codebase. The CourseMarkers class uses them to determine appropriate speeds for different track sections, with TURN_THRESHOLD and STRAIGHT_THRESHOLD helping identify track geometry. In the main control loop, these values drive the PID controller’s response, with ACCELERATION_STEP and BRAKE_STEP ensuring smooth speed transitions. When DEBUG_LEVEL is greater than 0, the ProfileManager modifies these base values according to the current operating mode, allowing for different performance profiles while maintaining the same core control logic.\n\n\n4.1.4 Control Parameters\nDefines the PID controller and sensor processing parameters.\n// PID Control Parameters\nstatic constexpr float K_PROPORTIONAL_DEFAULT = 5.0f;\nstatic constexpr float K_DERIVATIVE_DEFAULT = 600.0f;\nstatic constexpr float FILTER_COEFFICIENT_DEFAULT = 0.6f;\n\n// Sensor Parameters\nstatic const uint8_t NUM_SENSORES = 6;\nstatic constexpr int16_t SENSOR_MAX_VALUE = 1023;\nstatic constexpr int16_t SENSOR_MIN_VALUE = 0;\nstatic constexpr int16_t SENSOR_THRESHOLD = 120;\n\n// Sensor Weights\nstatic constexpr float SENSOR_WEIGHT_S1 = -2.5f;  // Far left\nstatic constexpr float SENSOR_WEIGHT_S2 = -1.2f;  // Left\nstatic constexpr float SENSOR_WEIGHT_S3 = -0.6f;  // Center-left\nstatic constexpr float SENSOR_WEIGHT_S4 = 0.6f;   // Center-right\nstatic constexpr float SENSOR_WEIGHT_S5 = 1.2f;   // Right\nstatic constexpr float SENSOR_WEIGHT_S6 = 2.5f;   // Far right\nThe control system parameters represent the core of the robot’s line-following behaviour. The PID controller uses carefully tuned constants, with a proportional gain (K_PROPORTIONAL_DEFAULT) of 5.0 providing immediate response to position errors, while the high derivative gain (K_DERIVATIVE_DEFAULT) of 600.0 helps predict and dampen oscillations. A filter coefficient of 0.6 balances between noise reduction and response time in the derivative calculation.\nThe sensor array consists of six sensors (NUM_SENSORES), each providing analog readings from 0 to 1023 (SENSOR_MIN_VALUE to SENSOR_MAX_VALUE). A threshold value of 120 helps distinguish between line and background surface conditions. The sensor weights are particularly crucial, implementing a distributed sensing system where outer sensors (±2.5) have greater influence than inner ones (±0.6), creating a non-linear response that enhances stability in straight lines while maintaining sensitivity to curves. These weights are asymmetrical around the center point, allowing the robot to detect and respond to position changes with increasing urgency as it deviates further from the line. When processed together in the main control loop, these parameters enable the robot to maintain precise line following while adapting to various track conditions and geometries.\n\n\n4.1.5 Timing Parameters\nControls various timing aspects of the robot’s operation.\n// Delays and Timings\nstatic const uint16_t SETUP_DELAY = 600;           // Initial setup\nstatic const uint16_t CALIBRATION_SAMPLES = 400;   // Calibration precision\nstatic const uint8_t CALIBRATION_DELAY = 30;       // Sample interval\nstatic const uint16_t STOP_DELAY = 300;            // Final stop timing\nstatic const uint16_t DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 50;         // Button debounce\nThe timing parameters, all specified in milliseconds, govern critical operational sequences of the robot. The SETUP_DELAY of 600ms allows the system to stabilize after power-up, ensuring all sensors and components are ready for operation. During calibration, the system takes 400 samples (CALIBRATION_SAMPLES) from each sensor, with a 30ms interval (CALIBRATION_DELAY) between samples, providing a comprehensive baseline for sensor readings while balancing between accuracy and calibration time - resulting in a total calibration period of approximately 12 seconds. When the robot detects its final lap marker, it initiates a controlled stop sequence lasting 300ms (STOP_DELAY), allowing for smooth deceleration. Button inputs are processed with a 50ms debounce period (DEBOUNCE_DELAY), effectively filtering out mechanical noise and contact bounce while maintaining responsive user interaction.\nThese timing values were established during the November 2024 competition where RoboZero secured second place, proving their effectiveness under competitive conditions.",

While global variables are generally discouraged in software development, their use here is justified by the real-time nature of the system and the Arduino Nano’s limited resources.\n#ifndef GLOBALS_H\n#define GLOBALS_H\n\n// Global control variables\nextern int currentSpeed;             // Base speed\nextern bool isRobotStopped;          // Robot stopped state\nextern bool isStopSequenceActive;    // Stopping sequence active\nextern int lapCount;                 // End marker counter\nextern bool isPrecisionMode;         // Slow mode active\n\n#endif // GLOBALS_H\nThe currentSpeed variable serves as the base speed reference for the entire system. It is modified by various components including the CourseMarkers class during turns, the main control loop during PID corrections, and the ProfileManager when operating in debug modes. By maintaining this as a global variable, we avoid the overhead of function calls and parameter passing in time-critical control loops.\nThe robot’s state is tracked through three critical boolean flags. isRobotStopped indicates when the robot has completed its run or encountered a stop condition, allowing all components to safely cease operations. isStopSequenceActive manages the controlled deceleration process, triggered when the robot reaches its final lap, ensuring smooth and precise stopping. The isPrecisionMode flag enables the system to switch between normal and precision operation modes, affecting speed calculations and control parameters throughout the system.\nThe lapCount variable keeps track of completed laps, crucial for both normal operation and debugging modes. In normal mode, it triggers the stop sequence after one lap, while in debug modes (controlled by DEBUG_LEVEL), it follows the specified number of laps (5 for analysis mode, 3 for speed mode).\nAll these variables are declared as external (extern) in the header file, with their actual definitions residing in main.cpp. This approach maintains proper encapsulation while allowing necessary access across the system. Each variable is initialized at system startup and modified only in specific, well-defined circumstances, ensuring predictable behaviour despite their global nature.",

These macros are defined based on the DEBUG_LEVEL configuration:\n// Debug macros - only active when DEBUG_LEVEL &gt; 0\n#if DEBUG_LEVEL &gt; 0\n#define DEBUG_BEGIN(x) Serial.begin(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINT(x) debugPrintFlash(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINTLN(x) do { debugPrintFlash(x); Serial.println(); } while(0)\n#define DEBUG_PRINT_VAL(x) Serial.print(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINTLN_VAL(x) Serial.println(x)\n#else\n#define DEBUG_BEGIN(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINT(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINTLN(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINT_VAL(x)\n#define DEBUG_PRINTLN_VAL(x)\n#endif\nWhen DEBUG_LEVEL is 0, these macros expand to nothing, ensuring zero overhead in the compiled code. When debugging is enabled, they provide different printing capabilities: DEBUG_PRINT and DEBUG_PRINTLN handle Flash-stored strings, while DEBUG_PRINT_VAL and DEBUG_PRINTLN_VAL handle direct value output. The do-while construct in DEBUG_PRINTLN ensures proper behaviour when the macro is used in if-else statements.\nIn practice, these macros are used throughout the codebase to provide diagnostic information. For example, during sensor readings:\nDEBUG_PRINT(\"rightMarkerDetected: \");\nDEBUG_PRINT_VAL(rightMarkerDetected);\nDEBUG_PRINT(\" leftMarkerDetected: \");\nDEBUG_PRINT_VAL(leftMarkerDetected);\nDEBUG_PRINTLN(\"\");\nThe system outputs debug information at 115200 baud when enabled, allowing real-time monitoring of the robot’s behaviour while maintaining efficient execution.",
