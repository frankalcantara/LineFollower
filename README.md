Named **RobotZero**, this project embodies the concept of starting from zero - both for those beginning their journey in robotics and in homage to DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero. Like its namesake, which learned chess and Go from scratch, achieving mastery through self-play and analysis, RoboTZero is designed to be a foundation for learning through systematic data collection and analysis. Despite its diminutive size and seemingly simple purpose, the robot incorporates  logging and analysis capabilities that transform it from a basic line follower into a platform for understanding robotics fundamentals, control systems, and performance optimization. It represents "zero" not as nothing, but as the essential starting point for building knowledge and expertise in robotics.
